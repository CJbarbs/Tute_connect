##Tute Connect
This is my first attempt at the Coderfactory bootcamp term 2 Ruby on Rails project, the challenge was be able to build an application from deisgn through to deployment. I ended up remaking the application again from scratch when I ran into problems implmenting a user login system after I already made the comment system. I took ideas and what I learnt form this app and implmented this into my second attempt at the project.

The second (more successfull attempt) can be found here:

Tute connect was going to be a message board application to help connect students to tutors and tutors to students, I began developing the application with the help of an online tutorial. 

To run the application simply clone the repository, `cd` into the application folder and use command `rails server` to start a local server, then navigate to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your web browser, note that rails will need to be installed on the system to run the application.
